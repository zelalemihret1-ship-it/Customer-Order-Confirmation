Customer answer page update:
The Telegram card still has exactly ONE button: መልስ ለመስጠት ክፈት.
On the answer page, customer can Confirm, Reject, or choose Comment.
After choosing Comment, they type the comment and choose exactly one of:
✅ Confirm & Send Comment
❌ Reject & Send Comment
The selected decision and comment are saved and sent to the admin together.

Google Sheet control (main admin only)
--------------------------------------
Every order and every movement is written to a Google Sheet automatically:
  • Orders        – one row per order, always current (status, product, customer, delivery, comments, links)
  • Activity Log  – one new row per movement (created, delivered / not delivered, Confirmed, Rejected, comment, answer closed, admin assigned / removed, full sync)
  • Dashboard     – live totals and orders-by-product built from the two tabs above
The "📊 Google Sheet" button (and ⚙ settings: test / sync all) is shown ONLY to the main admin, and the server refuses everyone else.

One-time setup:
 1. Google Cloud Console → create a project → enable "Google Sheets API".
 2. IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → create one → Keys → Add key → JSON (download).
 3. Create a Google Sheet, click Share, add the service account e-mail (client_email in the JSON) as Editor.
 4. In Render → Environment add:
      GOOGLE_SHEET_ID               = the long id from the sheet URL (…/spreadsheets/d/<ID>/edit)
      GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON   = the whole JSON file content
      SHEET_TIMEZONE                = optional, default Africa/Addis_Ababa
      PUBLIC_BASE_URL               = your app URL (so card / answer links in the sheet are full links)
 5. Redeploy, open the app as main admin, tap ⚙ → "Test connection", then "Sync ALL orders" to back-fill old orders.
The sheet is a one-way record (app → sheet). Editing cells in the sheet does not change orders in the app.
